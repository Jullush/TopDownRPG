# TopDownRPG
I made those scripts for my RP game (Top Down) in 2D. I added only 3 scripts just for You to review it :) : One is Player Movement controller
(but it is not only "Player's" script, it refers as well to the Enemy object). One (named Log) is made for basic melee enemy
and is inheriting from the script called "Enemy". The last script uploaded is: GrowingSapling, and it is a script made for interactions with the Sapling Object.
If Main Character has The key item added to his invetory then He can plant a Sapling! (2D animation)
